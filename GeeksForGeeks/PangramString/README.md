## Description

Given a string s check if it is "Panagram" or not.

A "Panagram" is a sentence containing every letter in the English Alphabet.

```
Example 1:

Input:
s = "Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymph"
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
In the given input, there
are all the letters of the English
alphabet. Hence, the output is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "sdfs"
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
In the given input, there
aren't all the letters present in the
English alphabet. Hence, the output
is 0.
```
Your Task:
You do not have to take any input or print anything. You need to complete the function checkPangram() that takes a string as a parameter and returns true if the string is a Panagram, or else it returns false.

> Expected Time Complexity: O( |s| )

> Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
|s| denotes the length of the input string.

Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 104
Both Uppercase & Lowercase are considerable
