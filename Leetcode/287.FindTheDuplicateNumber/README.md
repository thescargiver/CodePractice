The solution below depicts the different ways to find out the duplicate number within an array. Check out Solution [here](./Solution.java).

## Problem statement

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 ```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

```
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```
 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 105
    nums.length == n + 1
    1 <= nums[i] <= n
    All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
